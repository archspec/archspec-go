# Archspec (Go bindings)
Archspec aims at providing a standard set of human-understandable labels for
various aspects of a system architecture  like CPU, network fabrics, etc. and
APIs to detect, query and compare them. 

This project grew out of [Spack](https://spack.io/) and is currently under 
active development. At present it supports APIs to detect and model 
compatibility relationships among different CPU microarchitectures.
